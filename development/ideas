No enemies for now

Need ability to link tiles to other maps, allowing travel between maps

Player light radius becomes exception, depends on equipped light item

Tile light items have concept of being on or off
Player can "use" them to toggle their light state

All lights use a light template
Light templates have a range, flicker rate, and a set of colors
When a light source calculates its fov, it also updates tiles within its light range
The update rate for lighting is limited by the flicker rate (which can be 0 to never flicker)
Tiles within the light range of the light source have a light background applied, causing them to render that color as
their background instead of their normal background
When a light source is toggled off, it clears the light background from all tiles within its range
