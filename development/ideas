No enemies for now

Need ability to link tiles to other maps, allowing travel between maps

Player light radius becomes exception, depends on equipped light item

Tile light items have concept of being on or off
Player can "use" them to toggle their light state

Consider issue of diagonal movement being slower

Only rerun fov in a given frame if lighting conditions have changed

Maybe have passage of time
Story stuff happens regardless of player's presence
Could mean some stuff will be missed on first playthrough
Big theme is knowledge

Ambient light for map

No Mana?
Some spells have costs of various sorts
gods are involved with magic
Some spells might need to be repeated to take effect
Little or no equipment items in game
Equipment is created, and possibly maintained, through magic

Various enemies or obstacles where magical knowledge, items, cleverness is needed

Powerful enemies that fight you in essentially a magic duel

The magic system should be logical
Written spells in the world provide clues to the way magic works
With knowledge of enough spells, the player can begin to be creative with magic

Magic source material should be incomplete, maybe sometimes conflicting, to show that the source material itself is not a complete list of possibilities

Primary mechanic will be "saying" spells aloud
Secondary mechanics support this, e.g.:
To cast some magic a circle must first be drawn
Certain items placed around the caster in a certain way
Time, weather, seasons, stars might affect some magic
Time can be relative to an event as well as specifically something like a time of day
Reputation with various gods affects various magic
Cost might be applied for some spells, like need for a sacrifice, or permanently losing some of a stat
Sanity might affect spell possibilities and effects, as well as be affected by magic, creating a sort of feedback loop

Different types of sacrifices, e.g.:
Cast over a dead body (or bodies!)
Cast over a live creature (or creatures!)
Type of creature or certain creature features affect possibilities or outcomes

Mostly or entirely, player should be faster than other creatures
Everyone should be pretty slow though

Maybe one kind of magic uses up light, thus making it darker in the area/world as spells are cast
Darkness carries its own dangers...

Play with the player's perceptions
Possibility of falling asleep and dreaming, and more adventure can happen in the dream state
