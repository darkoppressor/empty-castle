No enemies for now

Need ability to link tiles to other maps, allowing travel between maps

Player light radius becomes exception, depends on equipped light item

Tile light items have concept of being on or off
Player can "use" them to toggle their light state

Creatures should be affected by lighting just like tiles

Consider issue of diagonal movement being slower
